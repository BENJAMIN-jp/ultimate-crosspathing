- Fixed for BTD6 v36
- Added crosspathing for the Beast Handler
  - NOTE: Ninja Kiwi hardcoded a lot of stuff based on the Beast Handler only having up to two pets at once. 
    For now, Beast Handler crosspathing will consist of allowing you to get up to 5 upgrades in two paths, but not any additional in the third.

## MelonLoader 0.6.1
- [Updating to MelonLoader 0.6.1](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.6.1) will fix all previous known crashes with villages, boats, etc
- Will also be visible in the standard MelonLoader installer
