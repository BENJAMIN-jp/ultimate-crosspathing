# Ultimate Crosspathing

As always, requires [BTD Mod Helper](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/releases/latest).

This is a prototype I've been working on for algorithmically generating more crosspathing combinations.

With this mod, instead of your Towers being restricted to 5 Upgrades in one path and 2 in another, you can take your
upgrades in any path.

The default mode is keep the restriction of just 7 total upgrades so you can do 430s, 331s, 322s, 511s, etc, but if
you're really adventurous, there's a setting at the bottom of the options list you can enable to allow for all 15
Upgrades. You can also individually toggle which Towers get Ultimate Crosspathing, and changing any settings no longer
requires a restart.

I'm releasing this now because the majority of the combinations work okay, so there's a lot of fun to be had trying them
all out. I do intend to eventually make this much more polished and balanced.
