# Ultimate Crosspathing

As always, requires [BTD Mod Helper](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/releases/latest).

## New v0.1.2 Community Crosspathing Patches

Since the algorithm is only ever going to get so smart, there's going to need to be manual fixes to certain Crosspathing combinations one way or another.
So, I thought it would be nice if people didn't have to necessarily wait on me for those to happen.

I've implemented an easy system for members of the Community to create "Crosspathing Patch" mods that can be used alongside Ultimate Crosspathing to alter the behavior of generated towers.
Patches can be "published" as Github Issues on this repository using the appropriate tag.

The very first one is an example / template patch by me that has more information for those interested.

This is a prototype I've been working on for algorithmically generating more crosspathing combinations. 
With this mod, instead of your Towers being restricted to 5 Upgrades in one path and 2 in another, you can take your 7 Upgrades in any combination.
This means you can do 430s, 331s, 322s, 511s, etc.

I'm releasing this now because the majority of the combinations work just fine (no visuals obviously), so there's a lot of fun to be had trying them all out. I do intend to eventually make this much more polished and balanced.

### NOTE: The generation isn't very fast. Making the combinations for every single tower can take up to 2 minutes on startup. If you don't like that, you can go into the Mod Settings page and disable generation for Towers you aren't going to use.
