# Summary

With this mod, instead of your Towers being restricted to 5 Upgrades in one path and 2 in another, you can take your
upgrades in any path.

The default mode is keep the restriction of just 7 total upgrades so you can do 430s, 331s, 322s, 511s, etc, but if
you're really adventurous, there's a setting at the bottom of the options list you can enable to allow for all 15
Upgrades. You can also individually toggle which Towers get Ultimate Crosspathing, and changing any settings no longer
requires a restart.


# Quick Answers

### It says "Failed to load Assembly ... No Compaitibility Layer Found!"

[BloonsTD6 Mod Helper](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/releases/latest) is not installed correctly. Make sure that you have the latest version and that you've extracted the zip file so that there's "BloonsTD6 Mod Helper.dll" in your mods folder with that exact name.

### The cost of an upgrade is some some ridiculously high number?!?

That's the Ninja Kiwi way of saying the tower doesn't exist for you to upgrade to, which usually means Mod Helper isn't installed correctly. See previous answer. Also check the logs for the mod to see if there was an error generating the towers. *The cost itself is not the issue*
