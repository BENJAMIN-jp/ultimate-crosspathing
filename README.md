# Ultimate Crosspathing

As always, requires [BTD Mod Helper](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/releases/latest).

This is a prototype I've been working on for algorithmically generating more crosspathing combinations. 
With this mod, instead of your Towers being restricted to 5 Upgrades in one path and 2 in another, you can take your 7 Upgrades in any combination.
This means you can do 430s, 331s, 322s, 511s, etc.

I'm releasing this now because the majority of the combinations work just fine (no visuals obviously), so there's a lot of fun to be had trying them all out. I do intend to eventually make this much more polished and balanced.

### NOTE: The generation isn't very fast. Making the combinations for every single tower can take up to 2 minutes on startup. If you don't like that, you can go into the Mod Settings page and disable generation for Towers you aren't going to use.
